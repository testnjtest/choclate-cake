Ingredients

2 cups white sugar
1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs 
1 cup milk
½ cup vegetable oil 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 cup boiling water
¾ cup butter
1 ½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder
5 ⅓ cups confectioners' sugar
⅔ cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans.

Step 2
Use the first set of ingredients to make the cake. In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in the boiling water by hand. Pour evenly into the two prepared pans.

Step 3
Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.

Step 4
To make the frosting, use the second set of ingredients. Cream butter until light and fluffy. Stir in the cocoa and confectioners' sugar alternately with the milk and vanilla. Beat to a spreading consistency.

Step 5
Split the layers of cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate. Frost the outside of the cake.
